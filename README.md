# MUSIPAINTER: Music to figurative art
This repository provides the codes for generating artistic images from music inputs.
It was adopted to produce the paper "Musipainter: A Music-Conditioned Generative Architecture for Artistic Image Synthesis", whose abstract is the following:

"In the era of deep generative modeling, generative art has become one of the most challenging research fields. Understanding the potential of machine learning within the artistic domain is a key feature in exploring AIâ€™s role in human-machine co-creative processes. In this context, the paper focuses on developing a cross-modal deep generative model capable of creating artistic images from 30-second musical inputs. This contribution provides a detailed description of the generative pipeline, the dataset created for the experiment, and the evaluation metrics adopted. The results obtained are promising and provide a solid foundation for further exploration of cross-modal AI's creative potential, particularly from an artistic-semantic perspective."

The dataset adopted is Museart (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alfredobaione/museart).
